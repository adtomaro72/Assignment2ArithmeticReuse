# Assignment2ArithmeticReuse
Reusing a python library, https://github.com/thatsmorez/reusable_arithmetic_seng560, of basic arithmetic functions.
  
# How To Run Project
1.) Clone the repository to local machine: **git clone https://github.com/adtomaro72/Assignment2ArithmeticReuse.git**
2.) Change into the directory where the console python app lives: **cd SENG560Assignment2Reuse**
3.) Run the python app: **python SENG560Assignment2Reuse.py**

# Experience working with library chosen
The files were cloned down from github and added directly into the python projected I created. Then, all I had to do was import the reusable_arithmetic module. Overall, I thought the library was very easy to incorporate into my project. In larger projects, it may be beneficial to package this into a python package and reference it that way. I did not have to make any actual changes to the file, however, in order to use it. Thus, this would fall more under black box reuse, as no modifications were made to the file in order to tailor the project to run.
